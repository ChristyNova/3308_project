Title: Hipster Adventure Trail
Vision: To create a fun and geographical informational game where the user can use
strategies to overcome obstacles.
Automated Unit Testing for Java:
Used Junit as a way to run an automated test. TutorialsPoint.com offers a way to run your java
code and implement tests.
From TutorialsPoint.com:
First I created a java class file named TestJunit. Then I created a java class file named
TestRunner in order to execute Test cases. After compiling the classes, I could run the Test
Runner. I wanted to test first to see if the welcome screen produced desired results:
Compiling the source code....
$javac AdventureTrail.java 2>&1
Executing the program....
$java Xmx128M
Xms16M
AdventureTrail
===========================================
Welcome
to Adventure
Trail Press
enter to continue ===========================================
testPrintMessage(TestJunit): expected:<[Welcome to Adventure Trail Press enter to continue]>
was: < [Welcome to Adventure Trail Press enter to continue]>
true
Next I wanted to test to see if the Startup Menu would appear
Compiling the source code....
$javac AdventureTrail.java 2>&1
Executing the program....
$java Xmx128M
Xms16M
AdventureTrail
===========================================
Welcome

Trail 1.
Create Character 2.

New Game 3. Load Game 4. Help 5. Quit ]> was: :<[ Welcome to Adventure Trail 1.Create

true
Next testing the Help Menu:
Compiling the source code....
$javac AdventureTrail.java 2>&1
Executing the program....
$java Xmx128M
